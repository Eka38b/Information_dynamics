# 004_ABN_for_GRN

Autonomous Boolean Network (ABN) model example for a gene regulatory network (GRN).

## What it does

- Simulates ABN dynamics on a small network (Figure-8 style).
- Builds an ensemble and computes information-dynamical quantities over time.
- Uses `Simple_Binning` (histogram counting) for estimation.

## Outputs

- `Temporal_Results/`  
  Time series of information variables written by the model.
