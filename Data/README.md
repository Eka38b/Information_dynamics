# Data Directory

This directory contains simulation outputs and processed datasets
associated with the models implemented in this repository.

The archived dataset corresponding to the manuscript:

> “Dynamical Equations of Mutual Information and Transfer Entropy in Discrete Time”

is provided under:

Data/on_Model004/

That version (v0.1.1) is publicly archived at Zenodo and guarantees
reproducibility of the numerical results and figures reported in the paper.

For detailed instructions on reproducing Model 004 results,
please refer to:
